# ZMK Config for Sofle v1 with Dongle Support  
- Perform a **flash settings reset** on all three microcontrollers before flashing the firmware (this is required even for binding updates).  
- Tested with **SuperMini nRF52840 Pro Micro**, also compatible with **nice!nano v2**.  
- Always pair the **left side first**, followed by the **right side**.
